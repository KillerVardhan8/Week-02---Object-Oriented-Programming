## Overview

In Week 2, we focused on mastering Object-Oriented Programming concepts, which form the foundation of Java application development. You will learn how to design robust, maintainable, and reusable code using OOP principles.

---

## Day 1: Object Oriented Programming Fundamentals

- Understanding classes and objects  
- Defining instance variables and methods  
- Object creation process and memory allocation  
- Basic OOP principles introduction  

---

## Day 2: Java Constructors, Instance vs. Class Variables, Access Modifiers Concepts

- Creating and overloading constructors  
- Differentiating instance and class (static) variables  
- Access modifiers: public, private, protected, default  
- Understanding scope and encapsulation basics  

---

## Day 3: This, Static, Final Keywords and Instanceof Operator

- Using `this` keyword to resolve variable shadowing and call constructors  
- Static variables and methods at class level  
- Final keyword usage for constants and method restrictions  
- `instanceof` operator for type checking  

---

## Day 4: Object Modeling and Class Diagram

- Introduction to object modeling concepts  
- Designing class diagrams for OOP systems  
- Relationships between classes (association, aggregation, composition)  
- Visualizing object interactions  

---

## Day 5: Inheritance

- Concept of inheritance and code reuse  
- Using the `extends` keyword for single inheritance  
- Accessing superclass members using `super` keyword  
- Method overriding basics  

---

## Day 6: Encapsulation, Interface, Abstract Classes, and Polymorphism

- Encapsulation through private variables and public getters/setters  
- Abstract classes and abstract methods  
- Defining and implementing interfaces  
- Polymorphism: method overloading and overriding  
- Runtime polymorphism and dynamic method dispatch  

---

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed  
- Familiarity with Java basics (Week 1)  
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, or Eclipse  

---

## How to Use This Repository

The repository is organized by daily topics. Each folder contains Java files demonstrating the key concepts learned that day. You can:

- Explore the examples  
- Run and debug the code  
- Modify the code to experiment and reinforce your understanding
